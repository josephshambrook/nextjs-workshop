# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my Next.js Workshop repo. This is intended to provide an interactive introduction to many of the core concepts of Next.js.

## Prerequisites

To be able to learn Next.js effectively, the following prerequisite working knowledge is recommended:

- ES6 JavaScript: Pre-ES6 JavaScript knowledge still absolutely applies here, but you will see some newer syntax, such as [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) or [fancy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) [new](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat) [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). If you have not used these, I would recommend reading [this article by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/write-less-do-more-with-javascript-es6-5fd4a8e50ee2/) to get to know some of the the newer syntax.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): The JavaScript ~~framework~~ library of which Next.js depends on. Only working knowledge of the basics are needed here, such as component composition, passing props to components, and usage of the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- CSS: We hardly use any CSS here, but since we do not need to worry about browser support, we do take the opportunity to use newer CSS syntax such as [margin-block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block).
