# Next.js Workshop

A workshop intended to be delivered live, for introducing the core concepts and benefits of using Next.js.

> Note: Development of Next.js does tend to move fast, so this workshop could become outdated fairly quickly. I'll make an effort to keep it updated, but do note the version of Next.js added within `package.json` and whether a newer version of Next.js is available.
